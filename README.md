## Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This app leverages __face detection__ and __eye state analysis__ to monitor driver alertness in real-time. If the system detects prolonged eye closure (indicating drowsiness), it triggers an __alert sound__ to ensure the driver stays safe on the road.

Key Features:
- Real-time face and eye tracking
- Drowsiness detection using advanced algorithms
- Lightweight and efficient, thanks to Google ML Kit
- Alerts the driver before it's too late!
